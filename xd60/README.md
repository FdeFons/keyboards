The XD60 is a PCB designed by XUIDI. You can buy it from aliexpress
from chinese vendors. The one I bought was from KPRepublic. I used
a very conventional configuration except for the bottom row, where
I used a HJKL arrow key layout.

This board also supports QMK. This is the first custom board I
built.
