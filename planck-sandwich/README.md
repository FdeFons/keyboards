#Fixed Alps Grid Planck Sandwich Case

An Alps based planck sandwich case. I found an old matias pro keyboard at a thrift store and was harvested the switches. I only need about 50 good ones out of the 100 plus on the board. This is a fixed configuration plate so it should be very tight. The planck is the smallest practical keyboard I would build that can take these switches and be useful for actual work.

Ordered the plates from laserboost and a rev5 PCB from olkb. The matias came with caps, so hopefully there are enough leftover caps I can build a reasonable working keyboard.
